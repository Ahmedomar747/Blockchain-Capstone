# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

The capstone will build upon the knowledge you have gained in the course in order to build a decentralized housing product. 

# Contracts:
1. ERC721Mintable.sol
This file contains set of contracts the builds up to the ERC721MintableComplete contract which follows the ERC721 and ERC165 standards. Contract is inherited in the SolnSquareVerifier contract and was not deployed.
2. verifier.sol
The contract generated by Zokrates. contains verifyTx function used to validate proofs.

```bash
0xC9587F3A17E6f5fD57AE4b3Fa518cF3E4e144917
```
3. SolnSquareVerifier.sol
This contract joins the implementaion of ERC721 token with the proof validation contract. Inorder for a user to mint a token, they require to add a solution(proof) to the contract.

# Compile
The contracts are built and compiled using truffle compiler.
To compile run the following command.
```bash
truffle compile
```

# Testing
the library mocha was used for testing the contracts. There are 3 test files.
1. TestERC721Mintable.js
2. TestSolnSquareVerifier.js
3. TestSquareVerifier.js
A total of 10 test.
To run test run the following command.
```bash
truffle test
```

# Migration
The contracts are deployed on the Rinkeby live network. SquareSolnVerifier.sol and Verifier.sol are deployed.
To migrate the contracts run the following command.
```bash
truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby
```

# Zokrates
An opensource framework used to implement zk-snark in this project used to both generate proofs and generate verifier.sol contract.
